odin recipes task 1 for html
Up to this point I have learned how to set up git and use git as a sort of version control for my projects. It still gets a bit tricky and I have to reference back to the earlier lessons but I think in time I will get the hang of things. Additionally I have learned about html and a brief explanations of some of the tags, how they work and how to use them. 
In this project my aim is to use the knowledge gained so far to build as small recipie project.
