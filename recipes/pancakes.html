        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 c. (180 g.) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp. baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 1/3 c. whole milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. melted unsalted butter, plus more, softened, for cooking and serving </li>
            <li>Maple syrup, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a large bowl, whisk milk, egg, and vanilla. While whisking, stream in melted butter and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Gently fold dry ingredients into milk mixture until just combined (do not overmix; some lumps are okay).</li>
            <li>Preheat a griddle or other large heavy skillet over medium heat until hot but not scorching, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Melt enough butter to cover surface of griddle, then pour about 1/4 cup batter onto griddle. Cook pancake until bubbles form on top and sides start to lift from pan, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until bottom is golden brown and pancake is fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack. Wipe off griddle, then repeat with more butter and remaining batter (you should get about 10 pancakes). </li>
            <li>Divide pancakes among plates. Serve with butter and syrup.</li>
