        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and devein shrimp; reserve shells. In a large bowl, toss shrimp, 1 tablespoon curry paste, and 3/4 teaspoon salt until coated.</li>
            <li>In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil until shimmering. Add shrimp mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are opaque and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer shrimp to a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>In same pot over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Cook lemongrass and white scallion parts, stirring, until slightly softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add garlic, ginger, coriander, and remaining 3 tablespoons curry paste. Cook, stirring, until very fragrant and starting to slightly char, 2 to 3 minutes. Add shrimp shells and cook, stirring, until shells begin to turn pink, about 3 minutes more. Add broth, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and flavors have melded, about 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook noodles according to package directions. Drain and rinse with cool water. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and toss to coat to keep noodles from sticking together.</li>
            <li>Using a spider or large slotted spoon, remove shrimp shells from broth; discard. Increase heat to medium and add milk and mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms have softened, about 15 minutes. Stir in fish sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, and lime juice; season with salt.</li>
            <li>Divide noodles and shrimp among bowls. Ladle hot broth over noodles. Top with green scallion parts, avocado, bean sprouts, and cilantro.</li>
